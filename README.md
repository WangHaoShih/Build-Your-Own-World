# Build Your Own World Design Document

**Partner 1:** Ethan Reece

**Partner 2:** Wang Hao Shih

## Classes and Data Structures
**Hallway** - Left, Right, Up, Down methods. Class is used to construct hallways which are always (3, y >= 3) or (x >= 3, 3).

**Rooms** - Room constructs as a square or rectangle room which are always (x >= 4, y >= 4).

**Boolean Class** - Checks whether we can build a certain class in said area.
## Algorithms
Have a randomizer to determine size of the world.

Have a randomizer to choose which class to build.

## Persistence
How often are gonna make rooms?

Make a list of how we will utilize the sequence from seed.

Check to see if rooms are connected and if not connect. Assign coordinates to rooms to check if rooms are above or below another.
